# DotNet Microservices: A Comprehensive Microservices Solution

## Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive microservices solution built using .NET Core. It demonstrates the creation, communication, and deployment of multiple microservices, each with its dedicated database, all orchestrated through an API Gateway.

## Features

### Microservices Creation
- Basket Service: Uses Redis as its database.
- Catalog Service: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage.
- Discount Service: Employs PostgreSQL for its database needs.
- Ordering Service: Leverages SQL Server for data persistence.

### API Gateway
Ocelot: Acts as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.

### Inter-Service Communication

RabbitMQ: Facilitates asynchronous messaging between the microservices, ensuring smooth and efficient communication.

### Logging
Elastic Stack (ELK): Provides centralized distributed logging, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot the system.

### Containerization
Docker Compose: Enables containerization of each microservice and their respective databases, simplifying deployment and scaling.

### Testing
Comprehensive testing of each microservice and the entire system to ensure seamless integration and communication.

### Documentation
Detailed documentation of each step in the README, aiding others in understanding and replicating the setup.
